# About this Project
Pacemaker Device Control Manager application. Controls input to pacemaker device and reads output from the device. Visualizes realtime graphs and allows switching between different pacing modes.

Built with React.js, Node.js, Firebase, Serialportio.js, Chart.js, MATLAB Simulink, and Bootstrap.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
